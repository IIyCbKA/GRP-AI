## ðŸ¤– Description
**GRP-AI** is an application designed to forecast the Gross Regional Product (GRP). It operates in two stages:

- Initial Forecast: A baseline GRP prediction is calculated using predefined coefficients and formulas.

- AI Refinement: Users can input events into an AI-powered chat that might impact the regionâ€™s economy (e.g., a drought and its effect on regional income). This data is sent via an API request to the AI, which analyzes it and adjusts the forecast to improve accuracy.

By combining analytical calculations with AI adaptability, the app accounts for real-time external factors, delivering dynamic and precise predictions.
